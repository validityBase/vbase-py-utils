# Python Dependency Hashes

This repository uses pip hash-checking mode for reproducible Python dependency
installs in CI.

Lock files are generated with Python 3.11 for CI parity.

## Files

- `requirements.in` is the human-edited runtime dependency input.
- `requirements.txt` is generated from `requirements.in` and includes pinned versions plus hashes.
- `requirements-dev.in` is the human-edited development dependency input.
- `requirements-dev.txt` is generated from `requirements-dev.in` and includes runtime, development, and lock-generation dependencies with hashes.

Do not edit generated `.txt` lock files by hand.
`setup.py` reads package runtime dependencies from `requirements.in`, so hashed
lock syntax is never passed to `install_requires`.

## Developer Workflow

Install pinned lock-generation tooling from the current development lock before
running `pip-compile`. Do not bootstrap with an unpinned `pip install pip-tools`,
because a different `pip-tools` version can produce a different lockfile.

```bash
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To add or update a runtime dependency:

```bash
# edit requirements.in
pip-compile --strip-extras --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt requirements.in
pip-compile --strip-extras --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes -o requirements-dev.txt requirements-dev.in
```

To add or update a development dependency:

```bash
# edit requirements-dev.in
pip-compile --strip-extras --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes -o requirements-dev.txt requirements-dev.in
```

Install local development dependencies from the generated lock:

```bash
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
```

## CI Enforcement

`.github/workflows/python-dependency-locks.yml` enforces this policy on pull
requests, pushes to `main`, and manual runs. It installs the development lock
with `require-hashes: "true"`, regenerates all lock files, fails if generated
files differ from committed files, installs the package locally without
dependency resolution, and runs `python -m pip check`.
